              The terms
              “Klper”, “we”, “us” and “our” include Klper LLC and our affiliates. We use the terms “member”, “you” and
              “your” to
              mean any person
              using our Platform or attending related events, including any organization or person using the Platform on
              an
              organization’s behalf. This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of information about members and
              other individuals
              that we collect when you use our “Platform,” which means any website, application, or services we offer,
              or when you
              communicate with us. For information about choices you may have under this policy, please see “Your
              Choices” below. This
              Privacy Policy does not apply to the information that you may provide to third parties, such as members,
              and others with
              whom you may share information about yourself. For more information about the scope of our Privacy Policy,
              please see

              not part of the

              <strong>We Collect Automatically When You Use the Platform</strong><br>
              When you use our Platform, we automatically collect internet and other electronic network activity
              information about you
              and other information, including:<br>

              Log Information: We collect log information about your use of the Platform, including the type of browser
              that you use;
              the time, duration, and frequency of your access; Platform pages viewed; your IP address; and the page you

              before visiting our Platform.<br>
              Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device that you use to access our

            <h4><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h4>
            <div class="row profile-box-body">
              <div class="col-12 p-0">
                Below is an overview of our Terms of Service for our “Platform”, which means any website, application,
                or service we
                offer.
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="self-desc">
              Below is an overview of our Terms of Service for our “Platform”, which means any website, application, or
              service we
              offer. You should read the complete Terms of Service because that document (and not this overview) is our
              legally
              binding agreement. The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such
              as automatic
              subscription renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather
              than a judge or
              jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.
              <br>
              <br>


              <strong>Your Relationship with Klper</strong>
              <br>

              By using our Platform, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service. The Terms of Service are a legally
              binding agreement
              between you and Klper.
              <br>

              If you break the rules, we may suspend or terminate your account.<br>
              We charge for certain aspects of our Platform, and some of these fees are billed on a regular and
              recurring basis
              (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription).<br><br>

              <strong>Klper Groups</strong><br>
              Organizers may establish membership criteria for their own Klper groups. While there is probably a Klper
              group out
              there for everyone, not every Klper group is for you. If you can’t find the right group, you can easily
              start your own
              Klper group.<br>
              Using our Platform involves meeting real people and getting help in the real world, which can
              sometimes lead to
              unexpected situations. We can’t control what happens in the real world, and we are not responsible for it.
              You should
              use common sense and good judgment when interacting with others.<br><br>

              <strong>Your Content and Content of Others</strong><br>
              You are responsible for your “Content”, which means any information, material, or other content posted to
              our Platform.<br>
              Your Content must comply with our Terms of Service, which includes the Usage and Content Policies, Groups
              and Events
              Policies, Member Restrictions, Payment Policies, Trademark Usage
              Guidelines, and API
              License Terms. Your Content is also subject to our Intellectual Property Dispute Policies.<br>
              We do not own the Content that you post. <br>
              We are not responsible for Content that members post or the communications that members send using our
              Platform. We
              generally don’t review Content before it’s posted. If you see Content that violates our Terms of Service,
              you may report
              inappropriate Content to us.<br><br>

              <strong>Our Platform</strong><br>
              We try hard to make sure that our Platform is always available and working, but we cannot guarantee it
              will be.<br>
              Occasionally things may not go exactly as planned. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.<br>
              We are continually improving our Platform. This means that we may modify or discontinue portions of our
              Platform.<br>
              By using our Platform, you agree to the limitations of liability and release in our Terms of Service. You
              also agree to
              resolve any disputes you may have with us in the manner described in the Terms of Service. Unless you are
              based in the
              European Union, you agree to mandatory arbitration and waive your right to seek relief from a judge or
              jury in a court
              of law. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.<br>
              You may be based in a country where the laws that apply provide for different or additional rights and
              obligations.<br>
              These Terms of Service will point out areas of difference.<br><br>
